# Git Talk Server
Chat service server Repository for `Github users`.
Add friends based on `github` data, and it provides chat function and push notification function.

Our primary goals are:
- Aim for test coverage of 80% or more and write test cases that verify all APIs.
- We finish the service completion and create an environment that users can actually use.
